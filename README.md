# Space Waves Clone

## 🎮 Project Overview
This project is a simple 2D space game inspired by *Space Waves*, developed in **Unity**. The game is designed to help learn fundamental game development concepts such as **player movement**, **collision detection**, **triggers**, and **version control using Git and GitHub**.

## 🛠 Features
- **Endless gameplay**: The game continues infinitely until the player crashes into an obstacle.
- **Player movement control**: The spaceship moves at an angle and changes direction upon input.
- **Collision detection**: The game detects when the spaceship hits an obstacle and displays a game-over screen.
- **Score tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's best score.

### Additional Features (Bonus Points)
- **Increasing speed**: The spaceship's speed gradually increases.
- **Dynamic obstacles**: Randomly appearing obstacles make gameplay more challenging.
- **Varying gap size**: The gap between top and bottom obstacles changes dynamically.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. The spaceship moves at an upward angle by default.
2. Press a key (e.g., `Space` or `Mouse Click`) to change the angle downward.
3. Avoid crashing into the ceiling, floor, or obstacles.
4. Try to survive as long as possible and set a high score!
